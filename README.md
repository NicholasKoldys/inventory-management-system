# Inventory Management System 
## WGU Project 2020
## Developed By : @NicholasKoldys

### Description
This project was developed for WGU's "SOFTWARE I - OBJECT ORIENTED APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT".  The purpose of the project invokes the practice of object-oriented design and is developed in the programming language **Java**.  It introduces a graphical user interface seperated into 2 sections, manipulation of parts and products.  Each Product has its associated parts, and each type has its defined attributes/fields.  The application gives the user the ability to manipulate the 2 types' attributes/fields by the basic CRUD principles, Create, Read, Update, and Delete, with alerts/prompts on warnings and confirmations.
